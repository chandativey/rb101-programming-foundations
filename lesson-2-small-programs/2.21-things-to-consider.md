# Things to Consider

1. Notice how the `display_results` method calls the `prompt` method. What happens if you move the `display_results` method definition above the `prompt` method definition? Does it still work?

Yes - Ruby has something called "late binding", where only the method call needs to be after the method definition. 

2. Create another method called `test_method` at the very top, before the `prompt` method definition. Now try invoking the newly created method from just *after* the `prompt` method definition. Does it work?

Yes

Now try invoking the method again *before* the `prompt` method definition. Does it work? Why is there a different result? 

It doesn't work, because the second `test_method` method call is happening before the `prompt` method has been defined. Although method definition order doesn't matter so much amongst themselves, it does matter with respect to method invocation. 

3. How would you use the display_results method differently if it returned a string, as opposed to outputting the string directly?

In the main loop I could have "p display_results"

4. Running Rubocop on this code generates a lot of complaints about the display_results method being too complex. Can you think of a way to mitigate? We'll talk this in an upcoming assignment, but try to think about a possible solution. 

Instead of using an If Statement, perhaps we could have used a Case statement
