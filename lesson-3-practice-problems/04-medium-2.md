# Practice Problems: Medium 2

## Question 1

Every named entity in Ruby has an `object_id`. This is a unique identifier for that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always **the same** object.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
    puts


    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts
  end

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end
```

```
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152729580 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152729540 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
```
Ruby reuses the same `object_id` for 42, when the value is the same

```
a_outer id was 85 before the block and is: 85 inside the block.
b_outer id was 2152729580 before the block and is: 2152729580 inside the block.
c_outer id was 2152729540 before the block and is: 2152729540 inside the block.
d_outer id was 85 before the block and is: 85 inside the block.
```

Ruby does NOT change the id for any objects between outside and inside the block

```
a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 2152729580 before and: 2152728320 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 2152729540 before and: 2152728280 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
```

Changing the values has forced Ruby to create new objects and refer to them with the original value names

```
a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the block (compared to 45 for outer).
b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 2152728320 inside the block (compared to 2152728320 for outer).
c_inner is [44] with an id of: 2152728280 inside the block (compared to 2152728280 for outer).
d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the block (compared to 89 for outer).
```

Ruby re-uses the objects under the hood when it can, but uses different ones for different values

```
a_outer is 22 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 45 AFTER the block.
b_outer is thirty three with an id of: 2152729580 BEFORE and: 2152728320 AFTER the block.
c_outer is [44] with an id of: 2152729540 BEFORE and: 2152728280 AFTER the block.
d_outer is 44 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 89 AFTER the block.
(notice that each variable keeps its new object/object_id even when we leave the block.)

 => "ugh ohhhhh"
```
Once we leave the block, the variables defined inside the block lose their meaning.


## Question 2
Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.

Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)


  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts
end


def an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)

  puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the method and is: #{a_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the method and is: #{b_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the method and is: #{c_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the method and is: #{d_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts

  a_outer = 22
  b_outer = "thirty three"
  c_outer = [44]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
  puts

  a_inner = a_outer
  b_inner = b_outer
  c_inner = c_outer
  d_inner = c_inner[0]

  a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
  b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
  c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
  d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts
end
```

```
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152753560 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an idea of: 2152753540 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
```

Same as previous question's object ids.

```
a_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
b_outer id was 2152753560 before the method and is: 2152753560 inside the method.
c_outer id was 2152753540 before the method and is: 2152753540 inside the method.
d_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
```

Same as previous question's object ids. These "outers" are NOT the same variables as those outside, Ruby is simply re-using the objects, as these new variables have the same values as the ones outside.

```
a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 2152753560 before and: 2152752300 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 2152753540 before and: 2152752280 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
```

When we change the values of our "outers", Ruby uses new objects for these variables to deal with their new values.

```
a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the method (compared to 45 for outer).
b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 2152752300 inside the method (compared to 2152752300 for outer).
c_inner is [44] with an id of: 2152752280 inside the method (compared to 2152752280 for outer).
d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the method (compared to 89 for outer).
```

Ruby is re-using objects that have the same values.

```
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152753560 BEFORE and: 2152753560 AFTER the method call.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152753540 BEFORE and: 2152753540 AFTER the method call.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
```

Even though we changed the values of our "outer" variables inside the method call, we still have the same values and the same object ids down here AFTER the method call as we had before it.

```
=> "ugh ohhhhh"
```

Our main method STILL has no access to variables that are defined inside of the method.

## Question 3
Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

```
My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
```

`String#+=` is reassignment and creates a new `String` object, which is assigned to `a_string_param`

With the array, we attach an additional element using `<<`. Ruby keeps the same object that was passed in and appends the new element to it.

## Question 4
To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.
```ruby
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

```
My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]
```

Our output is the opposite of the previous example! 

The method does the same thing to each object, but differently. In both cases the method attempts to change the string from `"pumpkins"` to `"pumpkinsrutabaga"` and add `"rutabaga"` to the array.

It's reliant on what Ruby does with local variables when we change the object it points to.

With the `Array#=` assignment, our literal `['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']` array is a **new object** and we're assigning it to the local variable `an_array_param`.


## Question 5
Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

Whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.

How can we refactor this practice problem to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?

```ruby
def not_so_tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]

  return a_string_param, an_array_param
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
my_string, my_array = not_so_tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```


## Question 6

How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?

```ruby
def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```

```ruby
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
```
